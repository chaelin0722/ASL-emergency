This repository contains the codebase for <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3663547.3759746">Signing for Care paper</a>, a prototype designed to support emergency medical service (EMS) providers in acquiring essential ASL vocabulary.

Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals face serious communication barriers in emergency healthcare settings, where the absence of interpreters can result in delayed or improper treatment. This system provides EMS personnel with:

- A vocabulary learning module tailored to emergency contexts
- AI-based recognition and feedback to practice ASL terms
- Video-based input and testing system for real-time feedback
 

## üìÅ Project Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asl-website/              # Frontend files (HTML/JS/UI for sign testing)
    ‚îú‚îÄbackend.js              # Node.js backend (video upload + Python inference)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model/                    # Python scripts and ML models for recognition 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .firebase/ and config     # Firebase (optional, not active in this version)
```
 

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaelin0722/ASL-emergency.git
cd asl-emergency
```

### 2. Install Node.js dependencies (for backend)
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Python environment (optional, for model)
If using the Python-based inference system:
```bash
#first, install python version 3.9
conda create -n env_name python=3.9
conda activate env_name
```

```bash
cd model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Program

### 1. Start the Node.js Backend Server
This handles file uploads and calls the Python recognition script.
```bash
cd asl-website
conda activate SLD-2025
node backend.js
```
By default, it runs on `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Start the Frontend
From the root directory:
```bash
cd asl-website
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Visit the application in your browser at: `http://localhost:8080/home.html`
 

## ‚ú® Features
- Record a signing video and run inference to identify the signed ASL term
- Receive top predictions and immediate visual feedback
- Interactive testing mode with retry logic:
  - 1st wrong attempt ‚Üí retry
  - 2nd wrong attempt ‚Üí skip and proceed to next term
- Vocabulary focused on 79 emergency-related ASL glosses

 

## üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Target Users
- EMS personnel (paramedics, EMTs)
- First responders in the field
- Potential future use by primary care physicians and pharmacists
